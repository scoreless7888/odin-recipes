        <p>This is a varation of a popular Filipino breakfast referred 
            to as &ldquo;silog&rdquo;. There are other varieties that 
            vary the meat and/or pork used with the dish. Typically, 
            garlic fried rice and over easy eggs accompany the choice 
            of meat. Common meats can be (but are not limited to) tapa,
             longanisa, bangus, bacon, and spam.</p>
        <p>The choice of rice and style of eggs can also vary 
            depending on individual preference. Freshly cooked rice can
             be prepared, or a variation of fried rice can be used 
            instead. Some may also prefer to have their eggs more 
            thoroughly cooked.</p>
        <p>Regardless, there is no wrong way to prepare a Filipino-
            favorite dish. Its flexibility is what makes it popular 
            among Filipinos.</p>
