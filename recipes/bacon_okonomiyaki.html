    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>I have always enjoyed Okonomiyaki and was pleasantly surprised 
    when I found this recipes when deciding on another webpage. It 
    brings me joy to be able to make a webpage about this dish!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried soba noodles</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package bacon, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, water, flour, soy sauce, baking powder, and 
        salt together in a bowl; set batter aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a saute pan over medium heat. Add onion; cook 
        until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir onion into
         batter. Add cabbage to the same pan; cook until slightly 
        wilted, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir cabbage into batter.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook soba
         noodles in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender 
        yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and cut noodles 
        into shorter pieces; stir into batter.</li>
        <li>Cook 1/4 cup bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat 
        until starting to crip, 2 to 3 minutes; arrange in a small 
        circle in middle of the skillet. Add 1 cup batter to the 
        skillet on top bacon; cook until brown and crispy, flipping 
        pancake halfway and pressing down with a spatula, about 5 
        minutes per side. Repeat with remaining bacon and batter.</li>
    </ol>
