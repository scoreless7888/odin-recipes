        <h1>Egg in a Whole</h1>

        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>This delicious breakfast is simple yet flavorful. What I 
        love is the variety available to me regarding how to cook the 
        egg.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 slice bread</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>salt and ground back pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt bacon grease in a nonstick pan over low heat.</li>
            <li>Cut a 2-inch hole in the center of bread slice; place 
            in the hot skillet and cook until lightly toasted, about 2 
            minutes. Flip bread and crack egg into the hole; season 
            with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until egg is cooked 
            and mostly firm; flip again and cook 1 minute more. Serve 
            immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Note</h3>
        <p>I prefer my eggs over easy or sunny side up. I personally 
        would not like to cook the egg as thorough as these 
        instructions.</p>
